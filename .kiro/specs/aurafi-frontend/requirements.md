# AuraFi Frontend Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document defines the requirements for building a Next.js frontend application that enables users to interact with the AuraFi protocol smart contracts. The AuraFi protocol is a creator-fan token system where creators deploy vaults, stake collateral to unlock stages, and fans mint/redeem creator tokens backed by CELO collateral. The token peg and supply cap are dynamically determined by an "aura" score (0-200) that reflects creator engagement metrics.

The frontend will support three primary user roles: **Creators** (who deploy and manage vaults), **Fans** (who mint and redeem tokens), and **Liquidators** (who restore vault health). The application will start with local Anvil development for rapid iteration, then migrate to Sepolia testnet for production testing.

## Glossary

- **AuraFi Protocol**: A DeFi protocol enabling creators to launch tokenized vaults backed by dual collateral (creator + fan CELO deposits)
- **Creator**: A user who deploys a CreatorVault and stakes CELO to unlock stages
- **Fan**: A user who mints creator tokens by depositing CELO collateral at 150% collateralization
- **Liquidator**: A user who injects CELO to restore vault health when collateralization drops below 120%
- **Vault**: A CreatorVault smart contract instance managing collateral, token supply, and lifecycle
- **Token**: An ERC20 CreatorToken representing fan ownership in a creator's vault
- **Aura**: A score (0-200) reflecting creator engagement, used to calculate peg and supply cap
- **Peg**: The current price of one creator token in CELO, calculated from aura (range: 0.3 to 3.0 CELO)
- **Stage**: A progression level (0-4) unlocked by creator collateral deposits, determining mint capacity
- **Position**: A record of a fan's mint transaction, tracking tokens and collateral for FIFO redemption
- **Health**: The collateralization ratio (totalCollateral / (totalSupply × peg)), expressed as a percentage
- **Supply Cap**: Maximum allowed token supply based on aura, calculated as BaseCap × (1 + 0.75 × (aura - 100) / 100)
- **Forced Burn**: A mechanism triggered when supply exceeds cap after aura drops, with 24-hour grace period
- **VaultFactory**: Smart contract that deploys new CreatorVault and CreatorToken pairs
- **AuraOracle**: Smart contract storing aura scores with IPFS evidence, updated by oracle service
- **Treasury**: Smart contract collecting protocol fees (0.5% of mint collateral)
- **Anvil**: Local Ethereum development network for testing (Chain ID: 31337)
- **Sepolia**: Ethereum testnet for production-like testing (Chain ID: 11155111)
- **wagmi**: React hooks library for Ethereum interactions
- **viem**: TypeScript Ethereum library for contract interactions
- **RainbowKit**: Wallet connection UI library
