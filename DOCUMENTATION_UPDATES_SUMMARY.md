# Documentation Updates Summary

## Overview
All three specification documents have been updated to reflect the refactored oracle integration architecture where CreatorVault dynamically reads aura from AuraOracle instead of storing it.

## Files Updated

### 1. requirements.md ✅

#### Changes Made:
1. **Glossary - Oracle Definition**
   - Updated from "Trusted address" to "A smart contract (AuraOracle) that stores aura values"

     - Oracle → AuraOracle.pushAura()
     - Vault → AuraOracle.getAura() when needed
     - Dynamic peg calculation
     - Manual forced burn trigger
   - Updated key design decisions

#### Changes Made:
1. **Task 5 - Data Structures**
   - Removed `lastAura`, `peg`, `lastAuraUpdate` from state variables list

2. **Task 9 - Fan Minting**
   - Updated to fetch current peg using getPeg()
   - Updated to fetch current aura from AuraOracle
   - Updated supply cap check to use current aura

3. **Task 10 - Redemption**
   - Updated to fetch current peg using getPeg()
   - Updated health calculation to use current peg

4. **Task 11 - Complete Rewrite**
   - Changed from "oracle aura update with forced contraction trigger"
   - To "oracle aura reading and dynamic peg calculation"
   - Removed updateAura() implementation
   - Added getCurrentAura() and getPeg() implementation
   - Added checkAndTriggerForcedBurn() implementation
   - Updated requirements references

5. **Task 13 - Liquidation**
   - Updated to fetch current peg using getPeg()
   - Updated all calculations to use current peg

6. **Task 14 - View Functions**
   - Added getCurrentAura() implementation
   - Added getPeg() implementation
   - Updated getVaultState() to return getPeg()
   - Updated getCurrentSupplyCap() to fetch current aura
   - Updated requirements to include 8.4, 8.5

7. **Task 15 - Events**
   - Added note: "AuraUpdated event is in AuraOracle contract, not CreatorVault"

8. **Task 16 - Errors**
   - Removed CooldownNotElapsed from CreatorVault
   - Added note: "CooldownNotElapsed error is in AuraOracle, not CreatorVault"

9. **Task 17 - Security Modifiers**
   - Removed onlyOracle modifier from CreatorVault
   - Added note: "onlyOracle modifier is only in AuraOracle contract"

10. **Task 19 - Oracle Script**
    - Updated to call AuraOracle.pushAura (NOT CreatorVault.updateAura)
    - Added note: "Oracle script only updates AuraOracle contract; vaults read from it automatically"

11. **Task 27 - Complete Rewrite**
    - Changed from "oracle aura updates" to "oracle aura reading and forced burn triggering"
    - Updated all test cases to reflect dynamic reading
    - Updated requirements references

12. **Task 27b - New Task Added**
    - Added integration tests for oracle-vault interaction
    - Tests multiple vaults reading from same oracle
    - Tests dynamic aura usage

## Consistency Verification

### Cross-Document Alignment ✅
- All three documents now describe the same architecture
- Oracle is consistently described as single source of truth
- Vault reading is consistently described as dynamic
- No contradictions between requirements, design, and tasks

### Terminology Consistency ✅
- "AuraOracle" used consistently for the contract
- "getCurrentAura()" used consistently for vault reading
- "getPeg()" used consistently for dynamic peg calculation
- "checkAndTriggerForcedBurn()" used consistently for manual trigger

### Requirement Traceability ✅
- All updated tasks reference correct requirements
- New requirements (8.4, 8.5) added where needed
- Requirement 5 completely rewritten and traced through all tasks

## What Was Preserved

### Unchanged Functionality
- All minting logic (except aura fetching)
- All redemption logic (except peg fetching)
- All liquidation logic (except peg fetching)
- Position tracking and FIFO accounting
- Stage progression and creator staking
- Mathematical formulas (calculatePeg, calculateSupplyCap)
- Security modifiers and access control
- Treasury fee collection
- Forced burn execution logic

### Unchanged Documentation Sections
- Introduction and glossary (except Oracle definition)
- Requirements 1, 2, 4, 7, 9, 10 (unchanged)
- Mathematical models section
- Testing strategy section (except Task 27)
- All other tasks not related to oracle
