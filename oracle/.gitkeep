# Oracle Directory

This directory will contain the oracle computation scripts for calculating creator Aura scores based on Farcaster metrics.

The oracle script will:
- Fetch Farcaster metrics (follower count, engagement, etc.)
- Compute normalized Aura scores (0-200 range)
- Pin evidence to IPFS
- Update vault contracts with new Aura values
